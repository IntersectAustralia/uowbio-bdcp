# uowbio-bdcp
The Biomechanics Data Capture (BDCP) will assist researchers in the [Biomechanics Research Laboratory](http://www.uow.edu.au/health/brl/index.html) at the University of Wollongon to organize data taken from specialized equipment, collect meaningful descriptions about the data, permanently store the data/description and publish the descriptions to the [Research Data Australia](http://services.ands.org.au/home/orca/rda/) federated catalogue.

The BDCP consists of a centralised repository where all the data is stored. Access to the data will be managed by a web application and management information will be stored in an Oracle Database. The authentication will be using LDAP so that users will be identified through their existing university accounts.

Please read the [wiki](https://github.com/vincentt143/uowbio-bdcp/wiki) for further information on architecture, build from source, installation and deployment.

The BDCP was built by [Intersect](http://www.intersect.org.au/) for the [University of Wollongong](http://www.uow.edu.au/)
