    Then I should see "saved"
    
    Given I am on the home page
    And I follow "Add Study"
    When I fill in "studyTitle" with "My Biomechanics Study"
    And I fill in "ethicsNumber" with "1073A"
    And I fill in "description" with "Test Description"

    And I fill in "inclusionExclusionCriteria" with "Test Criteria"
    And I press "create"
    Then I should see "saved"
    Then I should see "My Biomechanics Study"
    And I should see table "studyTable" with contents
